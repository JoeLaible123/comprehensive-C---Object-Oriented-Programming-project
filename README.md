demonstrating advanced OOP concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, and STL containers. Features a multi-level class hierarchy modeling WWI historical figures with dynamic memory management and vector-based data storage.  Key Features: • Multi-level inheritance (Base → Derived → Second-level Derived) • Virtual function polymorphism with overridden methods • STL vector containers with pointer management • Interactive user input system for dynamic object creation • Separation of interface and implementation • Template-based design patterns  Technologies: C++, STL, Object-Oriented Design
